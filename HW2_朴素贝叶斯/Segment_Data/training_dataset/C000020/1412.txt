Mark   your   answers   on   ANSWER   SHEET1 .   ( 2005 年 真题 原文 ) Canada ’ s   premiers   ( the   leaders   of   provincial   governments ) ,   if   they   have   any breath   left   after   complaining   about   Ottawa   at   their   late   July   annual   meeting , might   spare   a   moment   to   do   something ,   to   reduce   health - care   costs . They ’ re   all   groaning   about   soaring   health   budgets ,   the   fastest - growing component   of   which   are   pharmaceutical   costs . 41 . What   to   do ?   Both   the   Romanow   commission   and   the   Kirby   committee   on   health care - to   say   nothing   of   reports   from   other   experts - recommended   the   creation   of   a national   drug   agency .   Instead   of   each   province   having   its   own   list   of   approved drugs ,   bureaucracy ,   procedures   and   limited   bargaining   power ,   all   would   pool resources ,   work   with   Ottawa ,   and   create   a   national   institution . 42 . But   “ national ”   doesn ’ t   have   to   mean   that .   “ National ”   could   mean interprovincial - provinces   combining   efforts   to   create   one   body .   Either   way ,   one benefit   of   a   “ national ”   organization   would   be   to   negotiate   better   prices ,   if possible ,   with   drug   manufacturers .   Instead   of   having   one   province - or   a   series   of hospitals   within   a   province - negotiate   a   price   for   a   given   drug   on   the   provincial list ,   the   national   agency   would   negotiate   on   behalf   of   all   provinces .   Rather than ,   say ,   Quebec ,   negotiating   on   behalf   of   seven   million   people ,   the   national agency   would   negotiate   on   behalf   of   31   million   people .   Basic   economics   suggests the   greater   the   potential   consumers ,   the   higher   the   likelihood   of   a   better price . 43 . A   small   step   has   been   taken   in   the   direction   of   a   national   agency   with   the creation   of   the   Canadian   Co - coordinating   Office   for   Health   Technology Assessment ,   funded   by   Ottawa   and   the   provinces .   Under   it ,   a   Common   Drug   Review recommends   to   provincial   lists   which   new   drugs   should   be   included .   Predictably and   regrettably   Quebec   refused   to   join . A   few   premiers   are   suspicious   of   any   federal - provincial   deal - making .   They ( particularly   Quebec   and   Alberta )   just   want   Ottawa   to   fork   over   additional billions   with   few ,   if   any ,   strings   attached .   That ’ s   one   reason   why   the   idea   of   a national   list   hasn ’ t   gone   anywhere   while   drug   costs   keep   rising   fast . 44 . Premiers   love   to   quote   Mr .   Romanow ’ s   report   selectively ,   especially   the parts   about   more   federal   money   perhaps   they   should   read   what   he   had   to   say   about drugs :   “ A   national   drug   agency   would   provide   governments   more   influence   on pharmaceutical   companies   in   order   to   constrain   the   ever - increasing   cost   of drugs . ” 45 . So   when   the   premiers   gather   in   Niagara   Falls   to   assemble   their   usual complaint   list ,   they   should   also   get   cracking   about   something   in   their jurisdiction   that   would   help   their   budgets   and   patients . [ A ]   Quebec ’ s   resistance   to   a   national   agency   is   provincialist   ideology .   One of   the   first   advocates   for   a   national   list   was   a   researcher   at   Laval   University . Quebec ’ s   Drug   Insurance   Fund   has   seen   its   costs   skyrocket   with   annual   increases from   14.3   per   cent   to   26.8   per   cent ! [ B ]   Or   they   could   read   Mr .   Kirby ’ s   report : “ the   substantial   buying   power   of such   an   agency   would   strengthen   the   public   prescription - drug   insurance   plans   to negotiate   the   lowest   possible   purchase   prices   from   drug   companies ” [ C ]   What   does   “ national ”   mean ?   Roy   Romanow   and   Senator   Michael   Kirby recommended   a   federal - provincial   body   much   like   the   recently   created   National Health   Council . [ D ]   The   problem   is   simple   and   stark :   health - care   costs   have   been ,   are ,   and will   continue   to   increase   faster   than   government   revenues . [ E ]   According   to   the   Canadian   Institute   for   Health   Information , prescription   drug   costs   have   risen   since   1997   at   twice   the   rate   of   overall health - care   spending .   Part   of   the   increase   comes   from   drugs   being   used   to replace   other   kinds   of   treatments   part   of   it   arises   from   new   drugs   costing   more than   older   kinds .   Part   of   it   is   higher   prices . [ F ]   So ,   if   the   provinces   want   to   run   the   health - care   show ,   they   should prove   they   can   run   it ,   starting   with   an   interprovincial   health   list   that   would end   duplication ,   save   administrative   costs ,   prevent   one   province   from   being played   off   against   another ,   and   bargain   for   better   drug   prices . [ G ]   Of   course   the   pharmaceutical   companies   will   scream .   They   like   divided buyers ,   they   can   lobby   better   that   way .   They   can   use   the   threat   of   removing   jobs from   one   province   to   another .   They   can   hope   that ,   if   one   province   includes   a drug   on   its ,   list   the   pressure   will   cause   others   to   include   it   on   theirs .   They wouldn ’ t   like   a   national   agency ,   but   self - interest   would   lead   them   to   deal   with it 方法 决定 成功 与 成败 ！   ― ― 工欲善其事 ， 必先利其器 ！
